# DizzyCalc: Twisting Digits, Testing Minds


DizzyCalc is an interactive and unconventional calculator that turns basic arithmetic into a mind-bending challenge. It combines misaligned button inputs, reversed operations and unpredictable behaviors with an intent-based challenge system to create a confusing yet entertaining experience. MindBenders must first declare their intended calculation, then race against the clock to perform it correctly on the disorienting interface. Success is rewarded with Poin, while mistakes or timeouts result in a loss of Poin.
